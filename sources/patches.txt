The kernel patches have moved to a separate repository.

Please see my complete Linux Kernel trees, at:
https://github.com/evilwombat

Hero2 and Hero3 (and 3+) kernel:
https://github.com/evilwombat/gopro-linux

Hero4 kernel:
https://github.com/evilwombat/linux-hero4

Kernel config files may be found in these repositories as well.

Have fun!
